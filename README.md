# Naruto-Glossary-Server

For the backend we will use ktor framework which is built primarily on Kotlin  and Coroutines! You will learn everything about that framework, how to create your own endpoints, how to work with client requests, receive query parameters, process that same request on your backend, and finally send a fully prepared response to your clients, or in this case an Android App which we are going to develop as well.
